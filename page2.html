  <h1>My Love For Video Games</h1>
  <h2>How my Love Spawned</h2>
  <p>Like many others, I really started playing Video Games as a Kid, afterschool after homework of course. Nostalgia of
    those
    those days are high as I remember almost everything I played and ever game/game system I had. Most prominantly
    though, I
    remember how I would sit down on the floor, juicebox in one hand and controller on another, and I would pop in one
    of my
    favorite Characters as a kid, Sonic the Hedgehog. Some games I vividly remmeber playing were <i>Sonic Gems
    Collection</i>
    and <i>Sonic Heroes</i> for the playstation 2.
  </p>
  <h2>How that love matured</h2>
  <p>As I got older, so did video games. As a kid, I found it fascinating how much videogame graphics had evolved since
    the ps2
    era. When I went from Sonic Heroes on the playstation 2 which looked a bit rough around the edges and polygonal, to
    the HD
    release of Sonic Unleased My mind was blown. I do believe that had something to do with my passion for game design
    that I have now.
    As an adult, I love reading alot, so It makes sence my favorite games are those that are more story driven. One of
    my favorite
    franchises is <i>Fire Emblem</i> and <i>Final Fantasy</i>. But my favorite Franchise of all time is <i>Xenoblade
      Chronicles</i>.
    It makes me upset seeing also the bad ways that videogames have evolved, Which is when money is at the forefront of
    the game. recently,
    Micro transactions have taken over some of the most popular franchises like <i>Diablo</i>. Which is an example of a
    "Gatcha" game,
    Which in my opinion, is just a form of gambling where you get no money out of it, as you can pay 10000 dollars and
    you won't be guarenteed
    whatever you want. Crypto has also taken over some of the more popular games. NFT's (Non Fungeable Tokens) are a
    relatively new thing.
    and to see companies add them in beloved games like <i>Ni No Kuno</i> really saddens me, as this is not originally
    what games were all about.
  </p>
  <h2>My Top 5 Games!</h2>
  <ol reversed>
    <li>Final Fantasy 7</li>
      <p>Very nice RPG to start out with, not too hard to grasp. plus the story is amazing and respects the players time
        Remake is good in its own right, but its not anywhere near as good as the original, as it deviates from the
        story
      </p>
    <li>League of Legends</li>
      <p>not much to say here... I dont really play this game unless its with friends, but everytime I do, I have a
        blast</p>
    <li>Minecraft</li>
      <p>Unlike League of Legends, it doesn't require friends to be fun. Very relaxing, dont need to be a "gamer" to
        enjoy it</p>
    <li>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</li>
      <p>Game is so story driven it could be considered a novel. If a story about a wartorn country peaks your interest,
        and you enjoy strategy games, give this one a try! Its main theme is "perspective from different perspective's"
        as there are three different routes you can go.
      </p>
    <li>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</li>
      <P>
        While the first 1 is also amazing, I dont want to put two games from the same franchise on this list. But I
        would recommend playing through all three games if you enjoy long stories. It is a "pseudo action RPG" as battles play
        in real time, but attacks are automatic and special moves must be cast. While Gameplay is satisfying, the story
        is
        the reason you play this game. It truly is something else.
      </P>

  <h2>Video Game Music <strong>ROCKS!</strong></h2>
  <p>It would be a crime not to mention how good and important music is in videogames. It sets the tone of a scene or
    battle coming up and really helps set the mood. My favorite songs both come from <i>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive
      Edition</i>
  </p>
  <p>The first song my favorite battle theme: You Will Know our Names</p>
  <audio controls>

  <p>The Second song is my favorite music piece of all time: Xenoblade Chronicles - Main Theme</p>
