  <h1 class="Title">Who Am I?</h1>
  <p class="Intro">My name is Mosa! This website is here to give a bit more information about who I am</p>
  <h2>A little about me</h2>
  <p>I am a 19 year old Computer science major, My goal in life is to become a game developer, as I've always wanted to
    make my own game. Web design is also something that I had a vested interest in, Creating a website seems like fun,
    and what do you know, it is! Those are really the two areas of computer science that I am genuinly interested in.
  </p>
  <h2>Personal Life</h2>
  <p>I've got a big family. Consiting of my parents and 4 siblings, with me being the oldest. I currently have a part
    time job
    at a Kohls department store near my house, which allows me to save gas and simply take a 10 minute walk to work
    every day.
    I watch alot of youtube and only watch one sport, that being American Football (AKA the best sport!). The team I
    support is
    the Chicago Bears, While it may be true that they havent won a super bowl since 1985, they'll get there!
    (eventually...)
